        <h2>What is Web Scraping?</h2>
        <p>Web scraping is the technique of extracting information from websites. It can be used for various purposes, such as market research, academic studies, or business analytics.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "Data is the new oil." - Clive Humby
        </blockquote>
        <p>The extracted data can include various components like text, images, or even meta-information about the page itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Challenges in Web Scraping</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Website Structure Complexity: Many websites today are highly dynamic and loaded with JavaScript, making it challenging to extract meaningful data.</li>
            <li>Legal Issues: Always ensure that scraping follows website policies and local regulations.</li>
            <li>Captcha and Anti-Bot Mechanisms: Many websites use tools to prevent automated access, such as captchas and IP blocks.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Ethical scraping is essential. Always respect <i>robots.txt</i> and terms of service of websites.</p>

        <h2>Applications of Web Scraping</h2>
        <p>Some of the common applications include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Price Monitoring:</strong> Tracking competitors' pricing to adjust your own product prices dynamically.</li>
            <li><strong>Research:</strong> Gathering data from multiple sources to analyze trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media Analysis:</strong> Extracting user reviews, sentiment, and trends from social media platforms.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, <a href="https://example.com">this website</a> provides valuable data for market trends. Be mindful of terms of use when scraping such resources.</p>
